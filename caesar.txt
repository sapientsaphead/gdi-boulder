# A Soliloquy of Marc Antony

O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers
Thou art the ruin of the noblest man
Who ever lived in the tide of times
Woe to the hands that shed this costly blood
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
--- Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,
To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue ---
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
